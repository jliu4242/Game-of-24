### Introduction
The Game of 24 is a mathematical reasoning game where you are given 4 cards from a poker deck. The goal is to use basic mathematic operations (+,-,x,/)
to get 24 using the numbers on each card. i.e. jack is 11, queen is 12, king is 13. This version is a speed based game where the goal is to get as many points
as possible within a time limit. There are several options for the limits and points can be gained by answering questions correctly, or lost by answering incorrectly
or skipping a combination of cards.
